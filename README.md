## Contributing

We welcome issues & contributions.

If you create a pull request, **read the `CONTRIBUTING.md` first**.
We will reject PRs that fail to adhere to the `CONTRIBUTING.md` without further review.

**Please do not try to contribute to chapters that are not marked as finished in the progress section.**

We are specifically interested if you find one of the following:

- typos
- grammatical errors
- factual errors
- poor explanations that are unaccessible for beginners
- poor structure within a book section

This list is not exhaustive - if you think that an interesting piece of trivia or a funny joke would add value to this book, don't hesitate to contribute it.

When submitting improvement suggestions, remember that:

- this book should be suitable for beginners, i.e. all new terminology must be explained
- this book maintains an informal tone (and even dares to make jokes) to make it more accessible to a general audience
