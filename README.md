# Getting Things Done in Next.js

## What is this?

This is the repository for the book "Getting Things Done in Next.js", a book about the Next.js stack aimed at both complete novices as well as seasoned developers.

You can find the book itself at https://uhasker.github.io/getting-things-done-in-next-js/.

The book is in **alpha stage**.
This means that the "happy path" content has been completed, but there are a lot of TODOs for the individual chapters and you should definitely expect mistakes.

## Contributing

We welcome issues & contributions.
If you want to contribute, you can either create an issue or a pull request.
If you create a pull request, **read the `CONTRIBUTING.md` first**.
We will reject PRs that fail to adhere to the `CONTRIBUTING.md` without further review.

We are specifically interested if you find one of the following:

- typos
- grammatical errors
- factual errors
- poor explanations that are unaccessible for beginners
- poor structure within a book section

This list is not exhaustive - if you think that an interesting piece of trivia or a funny joke would add value to this book, don't hesitate to contribute it.

When submitting improvement suggestions, remember that:

- this book should be suitable for beginners, i.e. all new terminology must be explained
- this book maintains an informal tone (and even dares to make jokes) to make it more accessible to a general audience
