## A Simple Client

<div style="text-align: right"> <i> Why use a framework? I'll just write my own in a weekend. <br> â€” Seconds before disaster </i> </div>

### The Requirements

One day you sit around and dream about going outside as suddenly the dreaded _Project Manager_ approaches you and asks you to build a small task application.
The application should consist of a list showing the current tasks.
Additionally, a web form should allow the user to create a new task (which should then be displayed in the list of current tasks).

### The Initial HTML

You get to work and quickly come up with the initial document:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <title>Task List App</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Task List</h1>

    <!-- Task List -->
    <ul id="task-list"> </ul>

    <!-- Form to Add Tasks -->
    <h2>Add a Task</h2>
    <form id="task-form">
      <label for="task-input">Task:</label>
      <input type="text" id="task-input" placeholder="Enter your task" />
      <button type="submit">Add Task</button>
    </form>

    <!-- JavaScript will go here -->
    <script></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

You now have a heading, a list and a form.
However, if you click the submit button, not much happens.
After all, we haven't added any submit logic to the form yet.

### Grabbing the Items

Let's first grab the relevant items.
This can be done using the `querySelector` method.
In this case we want to select by ID, so we use the `#` selector:

```js
const taskList = document.querySelector('#task-list');
const taskForm = document.querySelector('#task-form');
```

Remember, the code goes between the `<script></script>` tags.

### Adding an Event Listener

Next, we need to add an event listener to the task form that will simply log the task input for now.
Note that we want to

```js
taskForm.addEventListener('submit', function (event) {
  // Prevent default form submission
  event.preventDefault();

  console.log({ inputValue: event.currentTarget.elements['task-input'].value });
});
```

Let's now store the task input in a variable and use `trim` to remove whitespace from both ends:

```js
taskForm.addEventListener('submit', function (event) {
  // Prevent default form submission
  event.preventDefault();

  const task = event.currentTarget.elements['task-input'].value.trim();
});
```

Finally, we will use the `createElement` method to create a new `li` element and the `appendChild` method to add the newly created element to our task list:

```js
taskForm.addEventListener('submit', function (event) {
  // Prevent default form submission
  event.preventDefault();

  // Get the task input
  const task = event.currentTarget['task-input'].value.trim();

  // Create a new task element and append it to the task list
  const li = document.createElement('li');
  li.textContent = task;
  taskList.appendChild(li);

  // Clear the input field
  event.currentTarget['task-input'].value = '';
});
```

If you click the button now, you will see that a new task will be added to the task list.

### Adding a Delete Button

As you complete the project, the _Project Manager_ once again walks up to you and remembers that it might be a good idea to allow the user to delete tasks.

Therefore, whenever you create a new element, that element should have a delete button.

To accomplish this, we first need to add a delete button to every task we create:

```js
const li = document.createElement('li');
li.textContent = task;

// New code starts here

const deleteButton = document.createElement('button');
deleteButton.textContent = 'Delete';
```

Next, we need to attach an event listener to the delete button:

```js
deleteButton.addEventListener('click', function () {
  taskList.removeChild(li);
});
```

Finally, we need to add the delete button to the task item:

```js
li.appendChild(deleteButton);
```

It's easy to see that our code is now all over the place and not really reusable.
Additionally, it's getting much harder to understand by the minute and we've only started writing our application.
This doesn't seem like it will scale to a larger project.

To simplify our lives, we will use a library called **React**.
The idea behind React is to create declarative UIs with nicely separated components.

Basically, we only declare how the application should look like and React takes care of the rest, including determining the necessary DOM manipulations.
As you will see soon, this will save us a lot of time.
