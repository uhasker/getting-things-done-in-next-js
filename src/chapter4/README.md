# Chapter 4: A Vanilla Client

<div style="text-align: right"> <i> Whenever you write a web app in vanilla JavaScript, you end up creating your own framework. <br> And who in their right mind wants another JavaScript framework? <br> - Common programmer idiom </i> </div>

In this chapter we will write a small example client in _vanilla_ HTML and JavaScript (i.e. without using any frameworks).
We will realize why using vanilla HTML is (usually) not a great idea and why we might want to consider using a library to help us out.
Spoiler alert: That library is going to be React.

If this sounds like a pointless exercise - it's not.
You need to know the basics of HTML anyway (even if you end up using React for your application).
Additionally, web development shouldn't consist of stapling a bunch of magic together and praying that it works.
In order to accomplish this, you will need a solid foundation to build on.

This chapter presents that solid foundation.
