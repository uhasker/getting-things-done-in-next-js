# Chapter 4: Persistence with SQL

So far we've introduced the programming language that will power our project (TypeScript) and some relevant networking theory.

But our users don't really care about the code we write nor the theory we know - they care about their _data_.
After all, the primary purpose of web applications is to ingest and show interesting data to the user.

Of course, it would be really bad if after every page refresh that data would be lost - therefore we need a way to store data _persistenly_ which is where _relational databases_ and the SQL language come into play.

This chapter will introduce these concepts.
