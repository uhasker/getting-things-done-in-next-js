## CSS Selectors

CSS selectors are used to target the elements we want to style.

You can use **type selectors** (also called tag name selectors or element selectors) to target all elements of a certain type.

For example, the following CSS will style all `<p>` elements:

```css
p {
  color: red;
}
```
