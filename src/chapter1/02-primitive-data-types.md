### Variables

Whenever we write programs, we need to manipulate data.
This data needs to be stored somewhere and we need to be able to access it somehow.
We also need to deal with the fact that when we execute a program, the values we deal with are not predictable in advance.
For example we don't know which tasks a user might create (that is kind of the point of writing our application).
Nevertheless, we must be able to access created tasks through a predictable name like `tasks` or `createdTasks`.

Therefore we need a way to put an _unpredictable_ value somewhere and refer to it using a _predictable_ name.
In programming, that "somewhere" is referred to as _storage_ and the predictable name as a _symbolic name_.

A **variable** is just that - a storage location containing a value which is referred to by a symbolic name.
This _sounds_ really fancy, but it just means that there is a value somewhere in your storage and you can refer to that value using a symbolic name that doesn't change (even if the value itself changes).

For example you could have a variable `age` which has the value `20` (we say that `age` is equal to `20`):

![](images/variable.png)

Now even if the value of `age` changes (e.g. to `21` because a birthday happened), the variable name doesn't change, only the value does.
The variable name will still be `age`, however now `age` will have the value `21` (i.e. `age` will be equal to `21`):

JavaScript lets you declare variables with the `let` keyword.
You can assign values to variables using the **assignment operator** (`=`):

```js
// Declare a variable
let x;

// Assign a value to a variable
x = 10;
```

You can print the value of the variable using the `console.log` method:

```js
console.log(x); // 10
```

> If you follow along in the Node.js (or browser) console, you don't actually need to use the `console.log` method to print the value of a variable.
> Instead you can simply type the variable (or any expression for that matter) and the console will display its value.

You can also have a declaration and an assignment on a single line. In fact, this is usually the way to go:

```js
let y = 10;
```

The value of a variable may change over the course of a program:

```js
let y = 10;
console.log(y); // 10

// Assign a new value to the variable
y = 20;
console.log(y); // 20
```

This will log `10` and then `20` to the console.

If you want to declare a predictable name for a value that never changes, you can declare a **constant**.
This is done using the `const` keyword:

```js
const ten = 10;
```

If you try to reassign a value to a constant, you get an error. For example if you do

```js
const ten = 10;
ten = 20;
```

you get

```
Uncaught TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.
```

You will almost exclusively see us using `const` instead of `let` from now on.
Reassignment is not nearly as necessary as you might think right now.

> You can also declare variables using the `var` keyword.
> We will not cover it here and you essentially only need to know one thing about `var` - you should _basically never use it_.
> It's mostly a historical artifact of the language at this point.

Any variable has a **data type** which denotes the range of values it can take and which operations can be performed on the variable.
You can use the `typeof` operator to obtain the data type of a variable.

We begin with a few particularly important **primitive data types**.
Let's talk about numbers, booleans, strings and `undefined`.

### Numbers

You've already encountered the `Number` data type:

```js
const age = 20;
console.log(typeof age); // number
```

Any integer or real number is a `Number`:

```js
console.log(typeof 42); // number
console.log(typeof -20); // number
console.log(typeof 3.4); // number
console.log(typeof -1.7); // number
```

You can perform arithmetic on numbers using the usual arithmetic operators `+`, `-`, `*` and `/`.
There is also the `%` (modulo) operator which returns the remainder of a division.
Finally, there is the `**` operator which does exponentiation:

```js
const a = 3;
const b = 4;
console.log(a + b); // 7
console.log(a - b); // -1
console.log(a * b); // 12
console.log(a / b); // 0.75
console.log(a % b); // 3
console.log(a ** b); // 81
```

You can also use the **shorthand assignment operators** to combine asssignment and arithmetic operators:

```js
let a = 3;
a += 4;
console.log(a); // 7
a -= 2;
console.log(a); // 5
a *= 3;
console.log(a); // 15
a /= 3;
console.log(a); // 5
a %= 3;
console.log(a); // 2
a **= 5;
console.log(a); // 32
```

You also use the **postfix increment** and the **postfix decrement** operators to increment or decrement a value by 1:

```js
let a = 4;
a++;
console.log(a); // 5
a--;
console.log(a); // 4
```

So far, so obvious.
However there are also some other things which have type `Number` like `Infinity`.
`Infinity` is a special value that represents mathematical infinity:

```js
console.log(typeof Infinity); // number
```

Additionally there is a special value called `NaN` (short for "not a number").
For example the result of `0 / 0` is `NaN`:

```js
console.log(0 / 0); // NaN
```

Hilariously, `NaN` itself is a number (despite the name):

```js
console.log(typeof NaN); // number
```

Don't let that confuse you.

Another important thing about numbers is that you need to be careful when you are trying to perform operations with real numbers.
For example if you add `0.1` and `0.2` you get a weird result:

```js
console.log(0.1 + 0.2); // 0.30000000000000004
```

This is not the fault of JavaScript, but instead has to do with the limitations of trying to represent numbers with a potentially infinite amount of digits on a finite hardware.

> We will not go into great detail in this book about this problem.
> If you're interested in more details we encourage you to have a look at the IEEE754 standard.

### Booleans

Another primitive type is the `Boolean` type.
This allows you to represent values which are either `true` or `false`:

```js
const thisBookIsAwesome = true;
const thisBookSucks = false;
console.log(typeof thisBookIsAwesome); // boolean
console.log(typeof thisBookSucks); // boolean
```

You can do simple logic using the logical operators `&&` (which denotes **and**), `||` (which denotes **or**) and `!` (which denotes **not**).

The `&&` (_and_) operator takes two values and evaluates to `true` only if both values are `true`.
Otherwise it evaluates to `false`:

```js
console.log(true && true); // true
console.log(false && true); // false
console.log(true && false); // false
console.log(false && false); // false
```

The `||` (_or_) operator takes two values and evaluates to `true` if _at least one_ of the values is `true`.
Otherwise it evaluates to `false`:

```js
console.log(true || true); // true
console.log(false || true); // true
console.log(true || false); // true
console.log(false || false); // false
```

The `!` (_not_) operator takes a single value and simply negates it, i.e. "switches" a value to it's opposite:

```js
console.log(!true); // false
console.log(!false); // true
```

Here is an example with all the operators together:

```js
const b1 = true;
const b2 = false;
console.log(b1 && b2); // false
console.log(b1 || b2); // true
console.log(!b1); // false
```

> Note that technically all the logical operators can take _any_ value (not just boolean values).
> The result of the logical operator application is then dependent on whether the values are _truthy_ or _falsy_.
> We will discuss this later.

A boolean variable usually occurs as the result of an expression.
Often it is the result of an expression containing the **strict equality operator** (`===`) which allows us to compare the values of variables:

```js
const x1 = 5;
const x2 = 10;
const x3 = 5;
console.log(x1 === x1); // true
console.log(x1 === x2); // false
console.log(x1 === x3); // true
```

> There is also another equality operator (`==`) which performs various type coercions before doing the equality comparison.
> This operator can be best described as an April Fools' joke that somehow made it into the language.
> _Never use it_.

If you want to write _not equals_ you can use `!==`:

```js
console.log(5 !== 10); // true
console.log(5 !== 5); // false
```

Additionally you can also check if one value is less than or greater than another value.
This is most commonly done with numbers:

```js
console.log(2 < 3); // true
console.log(2 <= 3); // true
console.log(2 > 3); // false
console.log(2 >= 3); // false
```

### Strings

Another primitive data type is the `String` type.
A string is simply a sequence of characters and is used to represent text.
Strings are usually written using single quotes in JavaScript:

```js
const s = 'Some text';
console.log(typeof s); // string
```

> Note that it's also possible to write strings using double quotes, however in most projects strings are written using single quotes.
> We will stick to this convention.

The `+` operator works on strings and does concatenation:

```js
const s1 = 'Next.js ';
const s2 = 'book';
console.log(s1 + s2); // Next.js book
```

Note that instead of doing concatenation all the time you can also use **template strings** (also called template literals).
This allows writing JavaScript expressions directly inside strings.
Consider the following example:

```js
const s = 'world';
const greeting = `Hello ${s}!`;
console.log(greeting); // Hello world!
```

Template strings are written using backticks (_not_ single quotes).
They may contain so called _placeholders_ which are expressions embedded inside `${...}`.
These expressions can be any valid JavaScript expression that evaluates to a value implicitly convertible to a string.
JavaScript will then try to convert any value inside the placeholder to a string:

```js
console.log(`2 + 2 = ${2 + 2}`); // 2 + 2 = 4
```

You can get the length (i.e. the number of characters) of a string like this:

```js
const s = 'MERN book';
console.log(s.length); // 9
```

> Note that JavaScript does not have a special "character" data type (unlike Java for example).
> Instead, characters are simply strings of length 1.

There is much more to strings and we will return to them later.

### Undefined

Finally there is one more primitive type that is of interest to us, namely `undefined`.
There is only one value of this type: `undefined`.
If a variable has the value `undefined` this (quite logically) means that it hasn't been defined.
For example, whenever you have a variable that has been initialized, but not assigned to, it will automatically have the value and therefore the type `undefined`.

```js
let someVariable;
console.log(someVariable); // undefined
console.log(typeof someVariable); // undefined
```

You can also manually assign the `undefined` value to a variable:

```js
let someVariable = undefined;
console.log(someVariable); // undefined
console.log(typeof someVariable); // undefined
```

An important operator to know is the nullish coalescing operator `??`.
This operator takes two values and check if the left-hand side is `undefined` (or `null` - a value that we will not pay much attention to).
If the left value is `undefined` or `null` the nullish coalescing operator evaluates the expression to the right-hand side, otherwise it returns the left-hand side:

```js
console.log(undefined ?? 1); // 1
console.log(0 ?? 1); // 0
```

The `??` operator is commonly used to provide useful default values.

> Note that `string`, `number`, `boolean` and `undefined` are not the only primitive data types.
> However the other primitive data types will not be relevant for this book.
