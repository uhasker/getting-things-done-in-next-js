## Functions

### Declaring and Calling Functions

In our programs we often need to perform multiple common actions over and over again.
For example we might want to get the list of tasks assigned to a user at various parts of our task application.
Instead of writing code that (essentially) does the same thing again and again we could use a **function**.

Within the **function definition** we would specify what statements should be executed.
Then we can write a **function call** (also called **function invocation**).
This would then actually execute the statements specified in the definition.

We can use this mechanism to group common actions into a function and then just call the function whenever we need to execute those actions.

Here is a very simple function definition:

```js
function printGreeting() {
  console.log('Hello world!');
}
```

Function definitions begin with the `function` keyword followed by the function name (in this case `printGreeting`).
We will cover the meaning of the parentheses in a second, but the curly braces contain the _body_ of the function.
These are all the statements that will be executed when the function is called.
In this case we have one statement, which will simply output `Hello world!` to the console.

You can call / invoke the `printGreeting` function like this:

```js
printGreeting(); // Hello world!
```

You have as many statements as you want inside the function body:

```js
function printGreetings() {
  console.log('Hello world!');
  console.log('Hello again!');
}
```

These functions are not particularly interesting since they do the exact same thing for every function call.
In this case, we print the exact same greeting(s) every time.
But what if we wanted to (for example) output a different greeting depending on the user?

We can do this by defining **function parameters**.
These allow us to pass values into the function, so that the function can adjust its behaviour _depending on those values_.

The function parameters go between the parentheses:

```js
function printGreeting(user) {
  console.log(`Hello ${user}!`);
}

printGreeting('Jane'); // Hello Jane!
```

In this example we have a single parameter called `user`.
The function prints the greeting with the appropriate user.
Within the function call we then pass the user (in this case `Jane`) as an **argument** to the function.

We can also **return** values from functions using the `return` keyword.
This keyword is used to specify the result that the function should produce, which can then be used in other parts of your code.

Here is a function that takes a number and returns the square of that number:

```js
function square(num) {
  return num * num;
}
```

We can now use the function as follows:

```js
const squaredNum = square(3);
console.log(squaredNum); // 9
```

### Default Parameters

You can use **default parameters** to initialize parameters with default values if no values or `undefined` is passed:

```js
function add(x, y = 1) {
  return x + y;
}

console.log(add(1)); // 2
console.log(add(1, undefined)); // 2
console.log(add(1, 4)); // 5
```

### Rest Parameters

Sometimes it can be useful to pass an arbitrary number of arguments to a function.
This can be done via **rest parameters**:

```js
function sum(...args) {
  let result = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < args.length; i++) {
    result += args[i];
  }
  return result;
}

console.log(sum()); // 0
console.log(sum(1)); // 1
console.log(sum(1, 2)); // 3
console.log(sum(1, 2, 3)); // 6
```

### Functions are Objects

Despite the fact that using `typeof` on function will result in `function`, functions are really just objects.

This means that we can assign functions as variables, pass them to other functions as arguments and do all the other neat things we can do with primitives and objects.
For example we could assign the `square` function to a variable:

```js
const square = function square(num) {
  return num * num;
};
```

We could then call this like a regular function by doing e.g. `square(3)`.

This is called a **function expression**.
Note that the function may be **anonymous** (i.e. nameless):

```js
const square = function (num) {
  return num * num;
};
```

The syntax for calling such a function is still the same, e.g. we would still write `square(3)` to call the function.

### Arrow Functions

There is a shorthand notation available in JavaScript called the **arrow function** notation.
This notation allows you to omit certain keywords in certain situations.
For example here is how you could rewrite the `square` function using the arrow function notation:

```js
const square = (num) => num * num;
```

This is much shorter and less _tedious_ (haha) indeed.

For an arrow function you only have to specify the parameter(s), followed by an arrow, followed by the returned value.
If you have multiple parameters, you need to put them inside parentheses:

```js
const add = (x, y) => x + y;
```

You can also have multiple statements in the function body, but then you have to specify the `return` keyword and surround the statements with curly braces:

```js
const printAndGreet = (user) => {
  const greeting = `Hello ${user}`;
  console.log(greeting);
  return greeting;
};
```

As you can see this is not too different from a regular function declaration or expression (unlike the `square` function, where the arrow notation was much shorter).
It is therefore common practice to only use arrow functions for short functions like `square`.
However this is again just a convention.

One thing you might have noticed is that we only showed you **arrow function expressions**.
This is not an oversight but stems from the fact that there is no way to write a function declaration with the arrow function notation.

### Instance Methods

An **instance method** (often just **method** for short) is a function which is a property of an object.

```js
const greeter = {
  greet: function () {
    console.log('Hello, world!');
  },
};
```

You can call a method like this:

```js
greeter.greet(); // Hello, world!
```

Methods can refer to the properties of an object using the `this` keyword which is simply a reference to the current object:

```js
const task = {
  id: 1,
  title: 'Read the Next.js book',
  description: 'Read and understand the Next.js book.',
  longDescription: function () {
    return `${this.title}(ID = ${this.id}): ${this.description}`;
  },
};
```

You can call the method by writing `task.longDescription()`.
This would output:

```
Read the Next.js book(ID = 1): Read and understand the MERN book.
```

Methods can also change properties of objects.

We will not dwell on methods for too long, since we will not use them all that often as this would lead to a _ghastly_ thing called _Object-Oriented Programming_ (OOP for short).
Instead we want you to think _functionally_, which is what the next section will be about.

> The sentence about OOP was a joke and used correctly, OOP has its merits.
> We just wanted to be funny.
> We're very sorry about that and will now perform the appropriate penance procedure.

### Static Methods

Static methods are methods that are like regular functions which need to be prefixed with a name.
For example you can use `Number.parseInt` to parse a string argument:

```js
console.log(Number.parseInt('123')); // 123
```

Static methods will become important in a few sections, when we introduce a few useful static methods that deal with arrays and objects.

> Our definition of static methods is a bit ugly because the technically correct definition would require the concept of a class, which we're not going to introduce in this book.

### Scope

The **scope** of a variable is the part of the program in which it can be referenced.
There are three scopes that are important right now - the **global scope**, the **function scope** and the **block scope**.

> Later we will also learn about the module scope.

Consider the following script:

```js
let inGlobalScope = 0;

function f() {
  let inFunctionScope = 1;

  if (true) {
    let inBlockScope = 2;
  }
}
```

The variable `inGlobalScope` is in global scope and can be accessed by the entire script.
For example all of these `console.log` calls will correctly print the value of the variable:

```js
let inGlobalScope = 0;

function f() {
  let inFunctionScope = 1;

  if (true) {
    let inBlockScope = 2;

    console.log(inGlobalScope);
  }

  console.log(inGlobalScope);
}

f();
console.log(inGlobalScope);
```

This will log:

```
0
0
0
```

The variable `inFunctionScope` is accessible only from within the function `f`:

```js
let inGlobalScope = 0;

function f() {
  let inFunctionScope = 1;

  if (true) {
    let inBlockScope = 2;

    console.log(inFunctionScope);
  }

  console.log(inFunctionScope);
}

f();
console.log(inFunctionScope); // This will result in an error!
```

This will log:

```
1
1
file.js:16
console.log(inFunctionScope);
            ^

ReferenceError: inFunctionScope is not defined
```

Finally the variable `inBlockScope` is in block scope and is available only in the block of the `if` statement:

```js
let inGlobalScope = 0;

function f() {
  let inFunctionScope = 1;

  if (true) {
    let inBlockScope = 2;

    console.log(inBlockScope);
  }

  console.log(inBlockScope); // This will result in an error!
}

f();
```

This will log:

```
2
file.js:12
  console.log(inBlockScope); // This will result in an error!
              ^

ReferenceError: inBlockScope is not defined
```

### JSDoc

JSDoc is a markup language that can be used to annotate JavaScript code.
The most important use is to annotate functions.

For example, here is how you could annotate a function using JSDoc:

```js
/**
 * Calculates the sum of two numbers.
 *
 * @param {number} a - The first number.
 * @param {number} b - The second number.
 * @returns {number} The sum of a and b.
 */
function sum(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
```

This is useful if you have complex functions with lots of parameters.
Documenting your functions allows other developers to quickly understand their purpose without needing to read the function bodies.
